# FPGA-SVM-CORDIC-OPTIMIZATION
This repo is the the final project of the Advanced Digital Systems Design Class. The aim of this project is to improve the Classification algorithm of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The primary objective is to achieve as great throughput as possible. Main optimazation is performed on exponantial function by replacing it using a CORDIC function. Real variables are replaced by fixed variables and the bit accuracy - SVM accuracy is investigated with regard to the classification speed.
